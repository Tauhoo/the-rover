## Global stat

As I said the same action in this game can lead to different behavior if you have different value of stats. So, I list them below.

1. Speed
   This value is use to determine how much distance your vehicle can be moved in a turn. This value can be increased by many way. Look at example below.

- Some auto part give you more speed such as wheel.
- Some action card can give you more speed after it is activated.

2. Enery
   If you don't have enough energy you can not move your vehicle, So, you must try to find a why to increase this value.

- Every time the satellite is alive (Every 2 turn), your energy will be full to your capacity.
- Some action card can regenerate your energy.
