# Concept Art Design

This file contains all of my concept art design and resources. It contains 2 environment design and a character design.

## Garage art design

This is design of the garage that will be use for vehicle customization. In the game, the garage can appear everywhere inthe map so the design will be mobile building. The floor is depend on the terrian. In this art, I choose meadow terrain. And, the tools is sci-fi spaceshipe base to fit the them of the game.

## Map in game

As I said in mechanism section, the game is board game style. So, map of the game is generative terrain block pattern. In one map, it will consist of many type of environment.

## The Rover character design (Player)

To fit the game them, player design will be alien.
